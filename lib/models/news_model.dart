Trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store it in their trunks, branches, and leaves. This carbon sequestration helps to mitigate climate change by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Forests are estimated to absorb approximately 2.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, which is equivalent to around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.",
